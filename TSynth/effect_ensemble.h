// V. Pearson: Implemented delay buffer interpolation with floating point fractional indices and using a larger table
// to reduce audible delay sweep quantization noise.
// The fractional indices are stored in flash memory instead of being calculated at runtime and stored in RAM.
// #define LARGE_ENSEMBLE_LFO_TABLE uses a larger lfo table with only delay buffer interpolation.
// This is more precise and is slightly faster but takes more flash memory.
// With it undefined, lfo table and delay buffer interpolation are implemented with some extra processing and a smaller lfo table.
