# Instructions

The source code requires Teensyduino from [PJRC](https://pjrc.com) to compile. You also need CircularBuffer from Agileware and Adafruit_GFX, which are available in the Arduino Library Manager. Compile with 'Serial + MIDI + Audio'. Delete data_bandlimit_step.c if compiling using Teensyduino 1.54 beta9 and later.
