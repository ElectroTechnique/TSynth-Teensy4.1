Recommended - Get the firmware file from [RELEASES](https://github.com/ElectroTechnique/TSynth-Teensy4.1/releases) on the right-hand side of the main page.

Use [TyUploader](https://github.com/Koromix/tytools/releases/tag/v0.9.9) instead of TeensyDuino if you are tired of trying to press the Boot button on the T4.1
